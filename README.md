# Integrated Kid Games

**Overview**

This all started as an *End-Sem project* during my 3rd semester *Java Programming* Course in *IIIT-Bangalore*. I then coded `Game` as well as `Color Find` programs. As I fell in love with this project, I, during the *semester-end holidays*, extended it to include `Classic Arcade` game to the application. I also refined the classes, which I created as part of my project. I made the entire application more modular, and more object oriented.

**How to run the application?**

- Download the zipped application from the **master** branch of this repository.
- Unzip all the folders and files. 
- Use the executable jar file **IntegratedKidGames.jar** present in the **dist** folder to run the application.
